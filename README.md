# SvelteKit + Electron + Typescript + Tailwind
Clean and straightfoward sveltekit/electron boilerplate. You can use ES Modules with Electron in this template if you wish.

### Getting Started
There will be two `package.json` located in `/` and `/src-electron`. <br>
> SvelteKit is located in `/` and Electron is in `/src-electron`.

You can install the dependencies using the included `install.sh` i provided. If you want to install the dependencies manually, enter in both directories and execute `npm i` or `npm install`. <br>

Once installed, execute `npm run dev` in `/`. This will start up your development server for both electron and vite.

Logs and information for both electron/vite will appear in the terminal.
